# Authentication

Authentication is how you add your board to Taco. 

- 1. Go to [auth.tacobot.app](https://auth.tacobot.app/) and link your Discord account with your Trello account.

Yep. One step and it takes 2 clicks in under a minute.

Run T!boards to check and make sure it was successful.

And yes, you can even use private boards.
