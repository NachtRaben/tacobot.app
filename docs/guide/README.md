# Getting Started

To start with Trello bot, you must first go through the authentication process, which will allow TrelloBot to access your board.

If you are unsure how to carry out this step, check out the [Authentication Page](/guide/auth/).

## What do you want to do?

* I want to get notifications/messages when I change stuff on my board. Use a!webhooks for more info
* I want to edit cards and other items through TrelloBot: Use T!help, you will see a list of commands under the “editing” sub-heading.

## FAQ
* How do I give permission to other users to edit the boards? Create a role named “Trello” and give it to them.
* The bot isn’t responding to any of my commands… what’s wrong? Check you’ve added it to your server properly, make sure you are in a channel it has permissions to view.
* The bot is offline, why? Most likely it encountered an error, Yamboy1 or Coolguy3289 will start it back up as soon as they can. Ping them to let em know!

If you have tried all these methods and are still strugging, @tag a member in the Voluntary Support role.
